# 🧊 BLACKICE Academy

**BLACKICE Academy** is a hands-on, cinematic platform for learning **ethical hacking** and **defensive security**.  
Think of it as a fusion of *CTF labs*, *guided missions*, and a *Defender’s dashboard* — where you can not only **break in** but also **patch up**.  

🔥 Hack it.  
🛡️ Defend it.  
📈 Learn both sides.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Missions & Writeups** – progressive challenges with graded hints and solutions.  
- 🕹️ **Sandboxed CTF Labs** – safe, contained vulnerable targets (*e.g., Crack the login*).  
- 🌐 **Curriculum Tracks** – *Network Penetration*, *Web Exploitation*, *Forensics & Blue Team*.  
- 👨‍💻 **Defender View** – telemetry traces, diffs, and mitigation practice.  
- 🏆 **Gamified Learning** – leaderboards, badges, and community-driven competition.
